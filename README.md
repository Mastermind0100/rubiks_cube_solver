# rubiks_cube_solver
This was my first project as a member of the robotics club, roboVITics.
It was done in collaboration with two of my colleagues; 
[Unnikrishnan Menon](https://github.com/7enTropy7) and Siddhant Chaudhary

This code works on the basic algorithm of the so called "Beginner's method" of solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
Firstly you solve the topmost face, then work your way down. The bottom layer is tackled by forming a cross and then filling the gaps. Of course this explanation is too confusing. So I reccomend you to read my colleague Unnikrishnan's amazingly descriptive answer on Quora. I've put a link to the same at the end of this readme file.
This was just a fun project. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
Happy Coding!
